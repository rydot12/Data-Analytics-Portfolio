## Project Overview

This repository contains five structured labs completed in DTSC 550: Introduction to Statistical Modeling.

The labs progressively build foundational statistical programming skills using base R only. Emphasis was placed on:

- Reproducible coding practices  
- Avoidance of hard-coded solutions  
- Proper statistical computation  
- Structured data exploration  
- Clean and consistent syntax  

The progression moves from basic vector manipulation to dataset exploration, descriptive statistics, data cleaning, and visualization.
