## Overview

This lab introduces foundational programming concepts in Base R, focusing on vector creation, indexing, data manipulation, unit conversion, and descriptive statistics. The assignment emphasizes writing clean, reproducible code without hard-coding values or relying on external libraries.

All computations are performed using built-in R functionality to reinforce core statistical computing principles.

## Objectives

- Create and manipulate character and numeric vectors  
- Perform indexing operations  
- Modify vector elements programmatically  
- Convert measurement units (feet to centimeters)  
- Compute descriptive statistics (mean and median)  
- Apply rounding functions  
- Follow strict R coding style guidelines  

---

## Tools Used

- R  
- RStudio  
- Base R functions only (no external packages)

---

## Key Tasks Completed

- Created a character vector containing family member names.
- Stored numeric height values in a vector.
- Converted measurements from feet to centimeters using the standard conversion factor (1 foot = 30.48 cm).
- Retrieved specific elements using vector indexing.
- Created modified copies of existing vectors.
- Calculated:
  - Mean
  - Rounded mean (1 decimal place)
  - Median
- Applied vectorized operations for unit conversion.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Reproducible coding practices  
- Vectorized computation in R  
- Proper assignment and syntax conventions (`<-` operator)  
- Clean and readable code structure  
- Avoidance of hard-coded answers

## Why This Matters

Foundational R skills are essential for:

- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Statistical modeling  
- Predictive analytics workflows  

This lab establishes the computational groundwork necessary for more advanced modeling techniques in future coursework.
