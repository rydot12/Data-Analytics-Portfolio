# Programming in R Project

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on data manipulation, analysis, and iteration using R. The goal was to explore and analyze the SP500 dataset, calculate inflation-adjusted prices and earnings, and perform loop-based summary statistics.

**Tools Used:**  
- R / RStudio  
- Microsoft Excel (SP500.xlsx)
- R functions: subsetting, filtering, column creation, loops (`for`, `while`, `repeat`)

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Importing and cleaning datasets  
- Selecting, filtering, and aggregating data  
- Calculating new columns (RealPrice, RealEarnings, P/E Ratio)  
- Loop-based computation for averages and conditional summaries  
- Writing clear, reproducible, and professional R scripts

**Project Highlights:**  

**Part A:**  
- Loaded SP500 dataset and inspected rows and columns  
- Selected specific columns (SP500, CPI, Rate) and specific rows  
- Filtered data based on SP500 and CPI conditions  

**Part B:**  
- Filtered data using multiple conditions (Earnings and Rate)  
- Removed unnecessary columns (Rate)  
- Added calculated columns for RealPrice and RealEarnings  
- Created P/E Ratio column based on inflation-adjusted values  

**Part C:**  
- Computed average earnings using `for`, `while`, and `repeat` loops  
- Computed average earnings for dividends over 25 using multiple loop types  
- Ensured all calculations were reproducible and correctly labeled for professional presentation  

**Files Included:**  
- `Project5_Rscript_Dotson.R` — Full R script with all tasks completed 

**Outcome:**  
The project demonstrates proficiency in R for data analysis, looping, and calculations, while highlighting the ability to produce professional, well-documented scripts suitable for portfolio or real-world business applications.
