# Python Project – Data 600: Loops, Lists, and Calculations

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on manipulating and iterating through data using loops in Python. The goal was to apply variable creation, mathematical formulas, list management, and loop logic to simulate real-world business scenarios. Professional formatting and clear documentation were emphasized to prepare the project for portfolio use.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python / Jupyter Notebook  
- Microsoft Word (for screenshots and documentation)  
- Python concepts: variables, arithmetic operations, list creation and updates, indexing, `for` loops, and conditional logic

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Creating and using variables to perform financial calculations  
- Printing professionally formatted output  
- Building and organizing parallel lists  
- Inserting, removing, and updating list elements while maintaining sorted order  
- Using loops to compute values and apply business logic  
- Writing clean and readable Python code suitable for professional environments

**Project Highlights:**

**Part A:**  
- Defined variables for principal, interest rate, and repayment time  
- Calculated repayment amount using the simple interest formula:  
  *A = P(1 + i × t)*  
- Printed output using the required strict formatting (single space after colon, no space after dollar sign)

**Part B:**  
- Created parallel lists of employee names and years of service  
- Manually sorted employees in decreasing order of service  
- Added new employees (Gina, Herb, Iris) in the correct sorted positions  
- Removed Fred after his departure and added Jack with 6 years of experience  
- Printed updated lists at each stage to verify accuracy  
- Demonstrated mastery of list indexing and ordering

**Part C:**  
- Created a list of monitor order quantities  
- Applied tiered bulk-pricing rules ($100, $90, and $80 per monitor)  
- Used a loop to calculate total cost for each order quantity  
- Printed output using exact formatting as required for professional presentation

**Files Included:**  
- `Project6_Pythonscript_Dotson.html` — Complete Python script with solutions  
- `Project6_Pythonscreenshots_Dotson.docx` — Screenshots of Python code and outputs

**Outcome:**  
This project demonstrates strong proficiency in Python fundamentals, including loops, list manipulation, conditional logic, and formatted output. The structure and documentation reflect real-world, business-ready coding practices suitable for inclusion in a professional portfolio.
