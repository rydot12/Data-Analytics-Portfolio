# Relational Databases (SQL) Project

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on designing, managing, and querying relational databases using SQL. The goal was to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the Adventure Works database, and to design a custom database demonstrating data modeling, relationships, and SQL functionality.  

**Tools Used:**  
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Microsoft Word (for scripts and screenshots)  
- SQL: SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, Aliases, Views, Functions  
- Database design: ER diagrams, normalization (3rd Normal Form)

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Querying and extracting data from multiple tables  
- Using joins, aggregate functions, and calculated fields  
- Creating views and functions to simplify data retrieval  
- Designing a relational database in 3rd normal form  
- Documenting scripts with clear labeling and professional presentation

**Project Highlights:**  

**Part A:**  
- Extracted all relevant data from the Persons table including email, phone numbers, and addresses  
- Sorted, filtered, and formatted queries for readability and analysis  

**Part B:**  
- Analyzed departments, product subcategories, and product inventory using aggregation and grouping  
- Calculated averages, totals, and counts with meaningful column aliases  

**Part C:**  
- Designed a custom database with 4+ tables and many-to-many relationships resolved via linking tables  
- Created ER diagrams to visualize relationships  
- Wrote scripts to create tables, insert data, and enforce primary/foreign key constraints  
- Developed views, joins, and queries with calculated fields to demonstrate functionality  
- Created at least one SQL function to enhance database capabilities  

**Files Included:**  
- `Project4_SQLscript_LastName.sql` — SQL scripts for all queries and database creation  
- 'Project4 SQL Script Views'  

**Outcome:**  
The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL, relational database design, data extraction and analysis, and the ability to present database solutions in a professional, clear, and organized manner suitable for real-world business applications.
