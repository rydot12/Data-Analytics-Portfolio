# Excel Analytical Techniques Project

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on analyzing data using Excel to derive data-driven conclusions with appropriate statistical techniques. The dataset was real-world, uncleaned data, requiring data wrangling, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and regression analysis. The goal was to transform messy data into actionable insights.

**Tools Used:**  
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables and Charts  
- Formulas (IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS)  
- Descriptive and Inferential Statistics  
- Linear and Multiple Regression Models

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Summarizing quantitative and qualitative data  
- Creating visualizations to communicate findings  
- Calculating confidence intervals for means and proportions  
- Building linear and multiple regression models  
- Documenting methodology and analysis for professional presentation

**Project Highlights:**  
- Part A: Descriptive statistics with visualizations for selected quantitative and qualitative characteristics, including outlier detection.  
- Part B: Inferential statistics including confidence intervals, sample size calculations, and multiple regression analysis to predict outcomes.  
- Professional documentation: All worksheets labeled clearly with accompanying analysis and justifications for data handling decisions.  

**Files Included:**  
- `Project2_LastName.xlsx` — Excel workbook with all worksheets, calculations, and visualizations  

**Outcome:**  
The project demonstrates the ability to clean, analyze, and model real-world data professionally, using Excel to extract actionable insights and present them clearly.
